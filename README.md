# CoRCalculator - Library for centres of rotation computation for [Optimised Centres of Rotation Skinning][1]
An example on how to use the library is given in `example.cpp`.

The CMake file is tested on Linux and Windows.

When compiled with the flag `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, the `CoRCalculator` will print the times it has needed for each step.

The library has to be linked with the option `-pthread`, as it uses multithreading ([std::async](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/future/async/)).

### Dependencies
This library solely depends on the head-only library [`glm`](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html).
On Linux, installing `libglm-dev` with `apt` suffices.
On Windows, finding GLM may require some changes, as we do it manually.

### Shader
We provide GLSL vertex shader logic for these three skeletal skinning techniques:

* **[Linear Blend Skinning (LBS)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.14.9310)**
* **[Dual Quaternion Skinning (DQS)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1230107)**
* **[Optimised Centres of Rotation Skinning (CRS)][1]**.

The file `skeletons.glsl` contains the `perform_skinning` function, that computes one of these three methods, depending on a uniform variable.
The files `quaternion.glsl` and `dualquaternion.glsl` each contain utility functions for their respective mathematics and have to be compiled
together with the vertex shader because they are required by `skeletons.glsl`.
We split these files so that you may pick what you need, since the `skeletons.glsl` file has to be customized anyway (especially the layout locations of the attributes).
